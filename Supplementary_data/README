Detailed information on the datasets

The classification datasets present polyphyletic sequences where labeling is solely based on evolutionary origin (datasets one, four, and six) or host information (datasets two, three, and five). In contrast, all clustering datasets are synthetic metagenomic contigs generated by diverse microbial communities and present an increasing number of expected clusters. 
Nonetheless, all raw data accession numbers, fragments, and scripts used in this project are stored at github.com/labinfo-lncc/mnmer. If you require access to any of the files not listed above, please open an issue on GitHub or email atrv@lncc.br
Clustering datasets
The first dataset presents 25 clusters divided into 1,893 contigs generated from a mock community (Mockup dataset from Kang et al., 2015. Available at: http://portal.nersc.gov/dna/RD/Metagenome_RD/MetaBAT/Software/Mockup/). The second dataset has 32 clusters and 2,294 contigs from complex gut samples (Sharon et al., 2013. Available at: http://ggkbase.berkeley.edu/carrol/). The third, fourth, and fifth datasets are from the CAMI challenge (Sczyrba et al., 2017. Available at: http://portal.nersc.gov/dna/RD/Metagenome_RD/MetaBAT/Files/CAMI/) with varying levels of complexity. The Low complexity dataset has 44 clusters and 19,499 contigs; the Medium complexity dataset includes 232 clusters and 63,447 contigs while the High complexity dataset contains 1,074 clusters and 42,038 contigs.
