Description: The (m,n)-mer is a new statistical feature based upon conditional frequencies (conditional probability density distributions). It reads a FASTA file and generates a table describing the conditional frequency distribution of the selected (m,n)-mer in the sequences. This output is combined with class information to generate the feature matrix for classification.
