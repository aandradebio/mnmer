Title: (m,n)-mer - A Simple and New Statistical Feature for viral Classification
Version: 0.99.0

   	person(given = "Marco",family = "Grivet", role = "aut"),

Description: The (m,n)-mer is a new statistical feature based upon conditional frequencies (conditional probability density distributions). It reads a FASTA file and generates a table describing the conditional frequency distribution of the selected (m,n)-mer in the sequences. This output is combined with class information to generate the feature matrix for classification.
